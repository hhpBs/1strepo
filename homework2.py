#
# Make a program that has your name and the current day of the week stored as separate variables and then prints a message like this:

name,date = "Dima", "18.05.2022"
print ("Good day", name + "!" + date,"is a perfect day to learn some python.")


# Manipulate strings.

# Save your first and last name as separate variables, then use string concatenation to add them together with a white space in between and print a greeting.

name_1 = "dima"
name_1 = name.upper ()
date_1 = "18.05.2022"
print (name, date,sep=" ")

# Make a program with 2 numbers saved in separate variables a and b, then print the result for each of the following:

# Addition
# Subtraction
# Division
# Multiplication
# Exponent (Power)
# Modulus
# Floor division

a = 20
b = 5
print (a+b)
print (a-b)
print (a/b)
print (a*b)
print (a**b)
print (a%b)
print (a//b)
